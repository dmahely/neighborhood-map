# Neighborhood Map
_This project is the fifth project in the curriculum of Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree._ This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and KnockoutJS in addition to Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to create a responsive and easily scalable single page application that shows a map of various locations in Montenegro that the user can browse and interact with.

# Before Running the Application
There are no prerequesites to running this application on your machine.

# Running the Application
1. Download [this repository](https://github.com/dmahely/neighborhood-map). Click on the green Clone or download button, then click on `Download ZIP`. There's no need to log in or make a GitHub account. This will download a directory named `neighborhood-map-master`. You will most likely find it in your Downloads folder.
2. Open `neighborhood-map-master`. Inside, you will see a file called `index.html`. 
3. Right click on this file and open it in any web browser, or drag and drop it in any web browser.

# After Running the Application
You will see a webpage with a search bar, map and list of locations. If you click on a location from the list, its marker will bounce and a window will open to show the location's name and address. You can also browse the map by yourself or enter a search term which will shrink down the list of locations and markers on the map to only the ones that meet the entered search term. 
To add more locations to the application, navigate to `js/locations.js` and add a location in a similar way to the ones above. You just need the location's name and latitude and longitude.

# Acknowledgements
I drew inspiration for the design of the webpage from [Raye Keslensky's own project](https://github.com/lastres0rt/udacity-neighborhood-map-project).
